What is IPFS?
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. It's often called the "permanent web" because content is addressed by what it is (content-based addressing) rather than where it's located (location-based addressing like HTTP).

How IPFS Works - Key Concepts

Representing and addressing data
Routing data
Transferring data


Content Identifier (CID)
In IPFS, data is chunked into blocks, which are assigned a unique identifier called a Content Identifier (CID). In general, the CID is computed by combining the hash of the data with its codec. The codec is generated using Multiformats.

Example CID: QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco

Same content = same CID, even if uploaded by different people

2. Peer-to-Peer Network
Files are stored across multiple nodes (computers) in the network

No single point of failure (unlike traditional servers)

3. Distributed Storage
When you add a file to IPFS, it's:

Split into smaller chunks

Each chunk gets a CID

Stored across multiple nodes

4. File Retrieval Process
You request a file using its CID

IPFS checks which nodes have the content

Retrieves the file chunks from the closest available nodes

Reassembles the file for you

IPFS vs HTTP
Feature	HTTP	IPFS
Addressing	Location-based	Content-based
Availability	Single server	Multiple nodes
Speed	Depends on server	Faster (local cache)
Persistence	Temporary	Permanent*
*Persistence depends on "pinning" - someone must choose to keep storing the data

Common Uses of IPFS
Storing NFT metadata and media

Hosting decentralized websites

Distributing large datasets

Blockchain data storage

Censorship-resistant content

How to Access IPFS Content
Via public gateways: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/CID

Running your own IPFS node

Through browsers with IPFS support (like Brave)

IPFS creates a more resilient, permanent web where files aren't dependent on single servers staying online.
