EIP - Ethereum Improvement Proposal
ERC - Ethereum Request for Comments (BEP,PEP);
Understanding EIPs and ERCs (and Related Standards)
EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal)
What it is: A formal proposal to improve the Ethereum network. Think of it like a suggestion box where anyone can propose changes to Ethereum's rules or standards.

Simple analogy: Like suggesting a new rule in a board game that all players can vote on.

Example:

EIP-1559 (the fee market change that made gas fees more predictable)

EIP-20 (created the ERC-20 token standard)

ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments)
What it is: A specific type of EIP that defines standards for smart contracts (like token formats). These are the "blueprints" developers follow.

Simple analogy: Like USB standards - all USB devices follow the same shape/specs so they work in any USB port.

Common Examples:

ERC-20: Standard for fungible tokens (like USDC, DAI)

ERC-721: Standard for NFTs (like CryptoPunks)

ERC-1155: Hybrid standard for both fungible and non-fungible tokens

Related Standards in Other Chains
BEP (Binance Evolution Proposal)

Binance Smart Chain's version (e.g., BEP-20 is their token standard)

Example: BNB token uses BEP-20

PEP (Polygon Enhancement Proposal)

Polygon's improvement proposals

Example: PEP-18 defines MATIC token standards

Key Differences
EIP	                  ERC	                                             BEP/PEP
Scope	      Entire network Smart contract standards	    Chain-specific standards
Example	      EIP-1559 (fee change) ERC-20 (tokens)	         BEP-20 (BSC tokens)
Where	      Ethereum	Ethereum	                             Binance/Polygon
Real-world analogy:

EIP = Proposing a new traffic law

ERC = Standardizing car seatbelt designs

BEP/PEP = Same standards but for different countries' roads
