# Introduction to Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger that records transactions across 
a network of computers.It eliminates the need for intermediaries by using cryptography.

# How Blockchain Works (Key Concepts Established 2009)
Blocks: Data (e.g., transactions) is stored in blocks. Each block has a header 
with a timestamp, a reference to the previous block (via its hash), and a cryptographic
hash of its own data.

Chain: Blocks are linked chronologically, forming an immutable chain. Changing 
one block requires altering all subsequent blocks, which is computationally impractical.


Decentralization: Instead of a central server, the ledger is distributed across
a network of nodes (computers). Every node keeps a copy, ensuring no single point of control.

Consensus: Bitcoin used Proof of Work (PoW), where miners compete to solve     
mathematical puzzles to add blocks, securing the network and validating transactions.

The Second Generation: Ethereum (2015)
Smart Contracts: In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum, launched in July 2015.
 It introduced programmable blockchain via smart contractsâ€”self-executing agreements coded onto the blockchain.

Modern Blockchain -
Diverse Blockchains: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, new types emerged:
Public Blockchains: Open to anyone (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
Private Blockchains: Permissioned, for organizations (e.g., Hyperledger).
Consortium Blockchains: Shared among trusted entities.

Why Blockchain Matters
Trust: Replaces human intermediaries with technology-driven consensus.
Efficiency: Streamlines processes like cross-border payments or record-keeping.
Innovation: Enables new systems like tokenized assets, decentralized governance, and digital identity.
