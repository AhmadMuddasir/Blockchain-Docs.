WHAT IS cryptography

Cryptography is the backbone of blockchain . It ensures data is safe, authentic, and tamper-proof. Here’s how it works in
It protects data using special techniques like encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. chronological context:

How Does Cryptography Work?

#Encryption (Hiding Information)

Imagine you write a secret message to  you friend but use a special code (encryption) so no one else can read it.
Only your friend has the key to decode (decrypt) the message.
 Example:
Normal Message: "HELLO"
Encrypted Message: "XJQQT" (Shifted letters using a simple cipher)
Only someone with the correct key can convert it back to "HELLO".

#Decryption:

The person who receives "XJ9KQ" uses the same key to unscramble it back into "Hello".

#Hashing (Creating a Unique Fingerprint)

Converts data into a fixed-length unique code (hash).
Even a small change in the input creates a completely different hash.
 Example:

"password123" → ef92b778bafee...
"Password123" → 5f4dcc3b5aa76... (Completely different!)
Used for storing passwords securely.
Digital Signatures (Proving Authenticity)

Works like a seal or signature to confirm that data is original and hasn’t been changed.
Used in documents, transactions, and blockchain.
 Example:

You sign a digital contract → The receiver verifies your signature → Ensures it’s really from you.
Where is Cryptography Used?
 Messaging Apps → WhatsApp, Signal use encryption for private chats.
 Online Payments → Banks secure transactions using cryptography.
 Blockchain & Bitcoin → Cryptography secures digital currencies.
 Cybersecurity → Protects passwords, files, and networks.

Types of Cryptography
#Symmetric Cryptography:

Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

Example: You and your friend use the same secret code to lock and unlock a box.

#Asymmetric Cryptography:

Uses a pair of keys: a public key (shared with everyone) and a private key (kept secret).

Example: You give your friend a lock (public key) to lock a box, but only you have the key (private key) to unlock it.

#What is a Public Key?
A public key is like a lock. It’s shared with everyone and used to encrypt (lock) data.

Example: If someone wants to send you a secret message, they use your public key to lock it. Once locked, only your private key can unlock it.

#What is a Private Key?
A private key is like a key. It’s kept secret and used to decrypt (unlock) data.

Example: When you receive a message locked with your public key, you use your private key to unlock and read it.
