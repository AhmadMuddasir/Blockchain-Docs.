What is NFT 
An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique digital asset stored on a
blockchain that proves ownership of something like art
, music, videos, or virtual items in games.

How is an NFT Different from Cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) are fungible → 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
NFTs are non-fungible → Each NFT is unique and cannot be exchanged 1:1 like money.
Example:

You can swap a $10 bill for another $10 bill (same value).
But you CANNOT swap a rare digital painting NFT for a random NFT—they have different values.
