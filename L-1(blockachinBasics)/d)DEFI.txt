What is DeFi in Blockchain?

DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is a revolutionary movement that uses blockchain technology to recreate 
and improve traditional financial systems without relying on centralized institutions like banks, brokers, or 
insurance companies

How Does DeFi Work?
DeFi is built on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana. It uses smart contracts to automate financial services. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Smart Contracts:

These are programs that run on the blockchain and automatically execute when certain conditions are met.

Example: A loan is automatically issued when collateral is deposited.

Crypto Wallets:

Users interact with DeFi apps using wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

Tokens:

DeFi uses cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH, DAI) and tokens to represent assets or value.

Stablecoins:
