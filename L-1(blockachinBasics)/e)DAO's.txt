A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a community-driven
organization that runs on blockchain without central authority.
Instead of a CEO or board making decisions, DAOs use smart contracts
and voting by members to operate

How Does a DAO Work?
Smart Contracts Automate Rules

DAOs are powered by smart contracts (code running on a blockchain).
These contracts define rules (e.g., "Majority vote approves spending").
Token Holders Vote

People who hold DAO tokens can vote on decisions (e.g., funding a project, changing rules).
More tokens = More voting power (in most cases).
No Central Authority

No single person controls the DAO.
Decisions happen transparently on the blockchain.
