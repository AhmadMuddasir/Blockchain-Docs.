#What is Bridging in Blockchain? ðŸŒ‰
Bridging in blockchain refers to the process of transferring assets, tokens,
or data between two different blockchain networks.

How Does Bridging Work?
Suppose you need ZKSync testnet tokens for testing, but getting them directly
from the ZKSync faucet can be slow or unreliable due to errors or delays.
 This is where bridging comes in.

Instead of waiting, you can first get testnet ETH from 
a more accessible faucet, such as:
Google Cloud Faucet for Sepolia Testnet-
https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia

Once you have ETH on the Sepolia testnet,
you can use a bridge to transfer it to the ZKSync testnet.
The bridge will move your funds between the two networks,
allowing you to use them on ZKSync without needing to rely on the direct ZKSync faucet.

Remember you should have sepolia in eth testnet.
#How it is done?
step 1:Go to https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/?network=sepolia
step 2:In the top right corner select ZKsinc test network.
step 3:connect wallet.
step 4:then select amount you want to transfer from sepolia eth to zksync
step 5:continue

It will take approximately 15 minutes(for security purpose )
and you will get you zksync token in your metamask wallet. 
to verify you can simply go to this link-https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/
and paste your zksync address to search bar and you will see all your Tnx.
